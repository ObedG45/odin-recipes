# odin-recipes

I'm programming a website about recipes that I like using HTML, and reflecting on the things that I learned from the Odin Project (So far).
What I've learned so far:
- HTML-Boilerplate (links, images, headers)
- Command line interface (CLI)
- Git commands
- Cascading Style Sheets
- Box models
