        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>These sous vide eggs have a perfectly set white with a runny yolk. Poached eggs are normally cooked directly in simmering water, but that can be tricky and lead to rubbery, messy eggs. I have tried different variations of times and temps, and this is the best method I have found. Fresh eggs have tighter whites and produce the best results.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 large cold eggs</li>
            <li>1 pinch of salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Fill a large pot with water and place a sous vide immersion cooker into the water.</li> 
            <li>Set temperature to 167 degrees F (75 degrees C) according to manufacturer's instructions; allow 15 minutes for the water to heat.</li>
            <li>Gently lower eggs into the water using a slotted spoon. Immediately set a kitchen timer for 13 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove eggs from the water once timer is up and let cool for 3 minutes. Slide egg out into a small bowl or serve over toast. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
        </ol>
